Term Project_process-simulation
The term project must be a behavioral or process simulation. How can we distinguish a behavioral or process simulation from a Monte Carlo or statistical simulation? Look for a clock. If the program that runs the simulation has a clock that keeps track of time (knowing when each even occurs and being able to stop at any time to see the current state of nature), then that program is probably a behavioral or process simulation. It mimics actual behavior or processes in the real world.
