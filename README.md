# Optimizing Space Mission Sustainability: A Simulation Study on Oxygen Recycling and Astronaut Health

#### Abstract 
This study presents a SimPy-based simulation of closed-cycle life support systems for sustainable space missions, with a focus on oxygen recycling. Addressing the challenge of limited resources in space travel, this model simulates the oxygen cycle to improve the efficiency and reliability of life support systems. The simulation evaluates technological advancements in oxygen recycling and assesses physiological adaptations of astronauts, such as bone mineral density (BMD) and oxygen consumption (VO2), during extended missions. Primary Results demonstrate the efficacy of enhanced recycling techniques, reducing logistical burdens and supporting long-duration missions. These results offer significant implications for the sustainability of future space exploration.
