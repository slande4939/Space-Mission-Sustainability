# Optimizing Space Mission Sustainability: A Simulation Study on Oxygen Recycling and Astronaut Health

#### Abstract 
This study presents a SimPy-based simulation of closed-cycle life support systems for sustainable space missions, with a focus on oxygen recycling. Addressing the challenge of limited resources in space travel, this model simulates the oxygen cycle to improve the efficiency and reliability of life support systems. The simulation evaluates technological advancements in oxygen recycling and assesses physiological adaptations of astronauts, such as bone mineral density (BMD) and oxygen consumption (VO2), during extended missions. Primary Results demonstrate the efficacy of enhanced recycling techniques, reducing logistical burdens and supporting long-duration missions. These results offer significant implications for the sustainability of future space exploration.

## Methodological Framework: Simulating Space Life Support Dynamics
  The methodological framework integrates advanced simulation tools and comprehensive data analysis to model the complexities of life support systems in space environments. The key components include:
   #### •	Simulation Tools: Python and SimPy are utilized for data manipulation and to model critical life support processes such as air regeneration, water recycling, and food production in closed-loop systems. These tools enable the creation of detailed simulations that replicate the dynamic interactions within a space station's life support system.
   #### •	System Interaction: The framework models the interactions between astronauts and life support systems, focusing on essential resources such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, and waste. For example, the oxygen recycling system simulates the consumption and recycling of oxygen, ensuring a balanced supply, as demonstrated in the iterative simulations where oxygen consumption and recycling rates are dynamically adjusted to maintain equilibrium. This interaction is crucial for maintaining sustainability on long-duration space missions.
  #### •	Data-Driven Insights: The framework leverages empirical data to ensure realistic modeling of life support systems. This includes historical data from terrestrial analogs like Biosphere 2 and space missions, which are integrated into the simulations to enhance accuracy. The use of empirical data aids in the prediction of system performance and the identification of potential issues, allowing for the development of robust and resilient life support systems.
By combining these components, the methodological framework provides a comprehensive approach to simulating and optimizing life support dynamics in space, ensuring the sustainability and well-being of astronauts during extended missions.
